## Latest Projects
Here are my three latest projects:

### [Article_page](https://github.com/Guntars123/ArticlePage)
A dynamic article page built with PHP and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase. It incorporates a robust routing system to handle different URL requests and leverages a cache system to enhance performance and optimize data retrieval.
The website utilizes Twig as the template engine, and CSS for styling.

### [RickandMorty_page](https://github.com/Guntars123/RickandMorty)
An application that displays information about characters from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty." It utilizes PHP and the Rick and Morty API to fetch and display/filter character data. The user interface is powered by Twig, while the styling is implemented using CSS.


### [Giphy_page](https://github.com/Guntars123/Giphy_twig)
A fun application that allows users to search for and display animated GIFs using the Giphy API. Built with PHP, Twig, CSS.
